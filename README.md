# Overview
This is a pathfinding project that utilizes the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. The user can interact with the grid by clicking on a square to set it as the starting or ending point, or by clicking and dragging to create walls that the path must avoid. The resulting path is displayed in red on the grid.

# How to Run
The project requires Java to be installed on the machine. Once Java is installed, you can run the program by opening a terminal, navigating to the project directory and running the command java pathfinder.pathfinder.

# User Guide
- Click on a square to set it as the starting point.
- Click on a different square to set it as the ending point.
- Click the mouse after setting the starting and ending points to create walls that the path must avoid.

# Tools and Technologies
- Java
- A* Algorithm

# Conclusion
This project provides an interactive way to understand the A* algorithm and how it can be used to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. The user can set the starting and ending points, as well as create walls to test the algorithm's ability to find the optimal path. It is a useful tool for learning about pathfinding and the A* algorithm.
